below is done - but I need to figure out where to store
and where to import the movies array (database)

Next, in your index template (in the "views" folder) loop through
the messages array and for each one, display the user, text and
the date the message was added. Don’t forget to make your messages
available to your template by including it in the res.render
‘locals’ object (e.g. res.render("index",
 { title: "Mini Messageboard", messages: messages })).

setup 2 routes, the index '/' and a new recipe form '/new' 

Run a basic server

create folders and files for:
1. controllers
2. Routes
3. views
4. errors
