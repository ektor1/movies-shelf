only display films title. Add an open button that will pop a window
with rating and review

add button to redirect to add new movie page

create form to add a new film and make it populate movies array
fields: title, rating, review

below is done - but I need to figure out where to store
and where to import the movies array (database) - .render happens in the
router and .get in the app.js

Next, in your index template (in the "views" folder) loop through
the messages array and for each one, display the user, text and
the date the message was added. Don’t forget to make your messages
available to your template by including it in the res.render
‘locals’ object (e.g. res.render("index",
 { title: "Mini Messageboard", messages: messages })).

setup 2 routes, the index '/' and a new recipe form '/new' 

Run a basic server

create folders and files for:
1. controllers
2. Routes
3. views
4. errors
